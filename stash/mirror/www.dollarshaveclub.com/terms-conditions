<p class="western">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">8.1 - DISPUTE AND ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER</p>
<p class="western">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.</p>
<p class="western">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Summary:</strong></span></p>
<p class="western">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer&rsquo;s satisfaction by writing to our customer service department at members@dollarshaveclub.com or Dollar Shave Club, Attn: Customer Service, Box 5481, Santa Monica, California 90409. &nbsp;In the unlikely event that our customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if we have not been able to resolve a dispute we have with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT (OTHER THAN THOSE RELATED TO DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB&rsquo;S ENFORCEMENT AND PROTECTION OF ITS NAME AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS) through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. This includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p>
<p class="western">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.</p>
<p class="western">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">We each also agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply (despite the choice of law provision in Section 8.2 below). ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. Neither you nor Dollar Shave Club has the right to act as a class representative or class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim.</p>
<p class="western">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">All disputes relating in any way, directly or indirectly, to Dollar Shave Club for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, personal injury, intentional torts or other tort will be arbitrated according to the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in Los Angeles, California, including any dispute about the scope of this arbitration agreement, and including all questions about the types of disputes that are subject to this arbitration agreement, all of which you agree will be decided by the arbitrators, whose decision will be final and binding on you. Any issue concerning the extent to which a dispute is subject to arbitration, or concerning the applicability, interpretation or enforceability of this Agreement, including any contention that all or part of this agreement is invalid or unenforceable, shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and resolved by the arbitrators. You acknowledge and agree that, in any arbitration proceeding, no depositions will be taken, and all other forms of discovery of facts will be limited to those things that the arbitrators determine, in their sole discretion, to be necessary. Further, in any arbitration proceeding, (i) there shall be no award of punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential or other special damages, (ii) all damages claims and awards will be governed by the provisions of the California Civil Code, and (iii) the parties will conduct the arbitration confidentially and expeditiously and will pay their own costs and expenses of arbitration, including their own attorneys&rsquo; fees. If you are unable to afford the AAA fee, you agree to notify all persons against whom you have an arbitrable claim and give such persons the opportunity individually and as a group to pay such fee. The proceeding and the decision shall be kept confidential by the parties.</p>
<p class="western">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">8.2 &ndash; CHOICE OF LAW</p>
<p class="western">This Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules. Foreign laws do not apply. Arbitration or court proceedings must be in Los Angeles County, California. If any provision of the Agreement is invalid under the law of a particular jurisdiction, that provision will not apply in that jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded from this Agreement.</p>

<p class="western">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">9.2&ndash; GENERAL TERMS</p>
<p class="western">Dollar Shave Club may issue a warning, temporarily suspend, indefinitely suspend or terminate any Customer&rsquo;s right to use or access all or any part of the Site including any account thereon, without notice, for any reason in Dollar Shave Club&rsquo;s sole discretion, including without limitation breach of this agreement and/or violation of the Terms of Service, Dollar Shave Club&rsquo;s belief that such access would violate any applicable law, rule or regulation or would be harmful to the interests of, or potentially cause financial loss or legal liability to Dollar Shave Club or another user of the Site.

The parties shall at all times and for all purposes be deemed to be independent contractors and neither party nor its agents may bind the other party. This Agreement is only valid in the English language. This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or remedies on any third parties, except that each indemnified Dollar Shave Club Party shall be a third party beneficiary hereunder. Dollar Shave Club may assign or transfer its rights, or delegate any performance, under this Agreement to a third party in its sole discretion. Customer may not assign or otherwise transfer its rights, or delegate its performance, under this Agreement to any third party without in each and every case, Dollar Shave Club&rsquo;s express prior written consent. All terms which by their nature are intended to survive any termination of this Agreement, or any termination of your use of the Site, Content, Products or Memberships shall survive such termination.</p></div>            </div>
